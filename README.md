## Intro
### ðŸš€ Application Task Tracker: A Full-Stack Solution

This project is part of an assesment, it is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to help you efficiently track tasks related to different applications. The frontend is built with Vite, providing a fast and modern development experience, while the backend is powered by Node.js, offering a robust and scalable server-side solution.

### Technologies Used
- Frontend: Vite

    - Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool known for its instant server startup and hot module replacement (HMR), enabling rapid development cycles.
    - It leverages native ES modules for efficient development and production builds powered by Rollup.
- Backend: Node.js

    - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript, making it ideal for building scalable backend services and APIs.
    - It utilizes a single-threaded, event-driven architecture, enabling it to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
    - Express.js (a minimalist Node.js web application framework) can be used to manage routes and HTTP requests on the backend.
